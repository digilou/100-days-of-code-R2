# Week 11

## [70] Day 71: 2018-01-27

### Today's Progress

1. Worked through part of week 3 (Service Workers) of the Google Udacity Scholaship Mobile Web course.

### Time Spent

1 hr 20 min

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- `respondWith()`
- `event.response`
- `new Response('string of some sort', headers: {'Content-Type': 'text/html'})` (no `;` on the end)
- `event.request.url.endsWith('.jpg')` to hijack just jpg files with a response (file).

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- The Dr. Evil gif hijacking trick was great!
- I think I'm going to need to understand better what promises are.
- Week 3 is already giving me ideas to apply to side jobs and projects I'm working on.
