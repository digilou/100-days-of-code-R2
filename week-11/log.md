### Today's Progress

1. Worked through more of week 3 (focus on caching) of the Google Udacity Scholaship Mobile Web course.

### Time Spent

1 hr 20 min

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- `event.waitUntil` to signal progress of cache box install
- `caches.match(request)` to find a cache that exists
- `caches.open("a-cache")` to open a cache

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- Promises should NOT end with a semicolon. That's a hard lesson for me to grasp.
- Week 3 is slow going, and I sometimes feel like I'm in the wrong class. But I've come so far in coding that I KNOW I can do this when the time is put in.
