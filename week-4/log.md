# Week 4 Log

## [23] Day 24: 2017-12-10

### Today's Progress

1. Setup postgres in Rails app.
2. Generated static home page (login screen).
3. Began editing home page, its controller, route, and spec.

### Time Spent

1 hr 30 min

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- Postgres local installation and configuration in Rails app.
- Refresh: generating controllers with views, routes, and spec.

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- I "think" my database is all set up. The truth will come out when I start setting up users for login.
- Don't know why I'm still shocked that initial setup (database) took an hour. I really just want to code/design stuff.
- Feels good to be setting up a web app from back to front all by myself! Such grand hopes for my personal project (right now).
