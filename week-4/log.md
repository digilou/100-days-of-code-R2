# Week 4 Log

## [21] Day 22: 2017-12-08

### Today's Progress

1. Logged back into Heroku, started reading docs to figure out how to set up and deploy my photo-sharing Rails app with them. More time on DevOps than software engineering today.
2. Initiated new Rails app.
3. Installed carrierwave gem for photo uploading to AWS rather than Heroku.
4. Set up Git and pushed repo to Bitbucket.
