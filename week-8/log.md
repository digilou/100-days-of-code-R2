# Week 8 Log

## [49] Day 50: 2017-01-06

### Today's Progress

1. Troubleshooting for problems with user editing and all users list.
2. Set up github.io page for this repo so I can look back on it, given I never took extra time to blog on Carney Develop It.
3. Experimented with SVG in CSS.

### Time Spent

2 hr

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- Refresher: check user in Rails console with `User.find_by_id(50)` to find user with the id of 50. I used this to verify that Faker and seeds worked.
- Learned several ways to kill the rails server: `kill -9 {PID#}`, `ctrl+Z`, `killall -9 ruby`. All with mixed results!

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- Faker is working! It's something in my code that's broken.
- Tomorrow I'll go back to the master branch and start ch10 over, begrudgingly.

### Project I worked on

- Rails photo-sharing app
