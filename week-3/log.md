# Week 3 Log

## [15] Day 16: 2017-12-02

### Today's Progress

1. None. (Still fiddling with making user choice possible by keeping X and O visible, then making them disappear when selection happens)

### Time Spent

1 hr 11 min

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- ES6 `.includes()`, `.startsWith()`, `endsWith()` methods to find values within, starting with, or ending with. (from reading, not experimentation)

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- Forking pens seems to be the best solution to saving good work since there's no version control there.

### Project I worked on

- [FCC: Tic Tac Toe](https://codepen.io/digilou/pen/POOypV)

### Resources I found helpful

- JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd ed.

## [14] Day 15: 2017-12-01

### Today's Progress

1. Removed HTML fieldset (radios for x & o) and replaced with JS function to allow choice at gameStart.
2. As an aside, worked through pair troubleshooting of a Postgres database for Women Who Code.

### Time Spent

1 hr

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- Node as a JS testing ground. Mostly an idea that I'll experiment with later.
- Continue to ask for help. Usually women in tech really want to help other women in tech.

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- Did I mention that I really don't enjoy coding games? I prefer projects that are useful to all. (i.e. Weather API)
- Near the end of my hour, I finally started making headway on the X and O choice for the player. Oh well. Tomorrow.
