# Week 3 Log

## [20] Day 21: 2017-12-07

### Today's Progress

1. Reoriented myself after TicTacToe (temporary) fail by deciding next coding steps.
2. Started planning out son's photo sharing app in Rails.
3. Did mostly devops work to try to figure out where to host app, so I know which version of Rails I need to build on.

### Time Spent

1 hr

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- n/a

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- It's okay to move on. Always re-evaluate your goals and intents. (Why am I doing this? Because I want to deepen my programming knowledge by building things for myself)
- I've decided that since programming mindset is my weakness, I need to make a greater effort to practice little things. I still want to get better at JavaScript, so I think coding katas would help me. Bouncing between JavaScript and Ruby may help more, too. Syntax is less of a problem now, but the mindset is my hurdle since I've watered my design skills more recently. Best bets:

### Project I worked on

- Son's photo-sharing app (not public yet)

## [19] Day 20: 2017-12-06

### Today's Progress

1. Worked through a Women Who Code issue:
    - changed a hard-coded number to a constant variable,
    - updated seeds and locale files,
    - deleted a custom task (.rake) file.
2. Learned more about migrations and custom tasks.

### Time Spent

1 hr 34 min

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- The proper way to delete a custom task/rake file? In this case, just delete the file (not via the CLI).
- There's a difference between migrations and custom tasks in the lib directory.
- I have a little more understanding of locale config (en.yml) and seeds.rb files. Just a little.

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- I just didn't have the will to work on Tic Tac Toe. It's time to work on personal projects that are more motivating and have real results for me. Women Who Code keeps me learning, and builds on my Rails knowledge to reinforce knowledge needed for my own Rails projects.
- This troubleshooting took WAY longer than I anticipated. Actually, I've been working on this issue for days (off and on) now. Ugh. Initially it sounded easy. But at least the ups and downs have forced me to ask help from women who know what there doing. So, I've learned a little more, thanks to that humbling push.

## [18] Day 19: 2017-12-05

### Today's Progress

1. Still playing with different code snippet to make player choice available in Tic Tac Toe. No progress today.

### Time Spent

1 hr

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- None.

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- First step, always, eliminate distractions on the hard stuff. Which is hard to do when your code lives on the Internet.
- What is the best way for me to slide right back into where I left off? It seems it takes me at least 20 minutes to get reoriented.

## [17] Day 18: 2017-12-04

### Today's Progress

1. Forked Tic Tac Toe pen (again) with the approach of removing JS, and starting fresh by walking through the steps again.
2. Worked on functions, conditions, and event listeners that pertained to player choice.
3. Read more out of JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd ed.
4. Troubleshooted config (.yml) file for Women Who Code.

### Time Spent

1 hr

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- Perserverance is the only winning skill in coding.
- ES6 added `Map()` constructor (not quite like an object, but kind of), `Set()` which is like but not like an array, and `Symbol` which is another data type.

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- I needed to declutter what I was looking at, though it's good valid code. I forked my pen several times before trying different solutions. Now I've forked it once again to remove all the working code, so I can walk through the steps again to see if there's a better way to approach user choice. Confidence waining a bit, as I'm convinced I'm a designer, but I want this bad enough to suffer through growing pains.

## [16] Day 17: 2017-12-03

### Today's Progress

1. Floundered on a couple JS30 tutorials (speech recognition, geolocation) because they required more environment setup than I was prepared for. Skipped.
2. Worked through JS30 Whack-a-Mole game.

### Time Spent

1 hr 25 min

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- ES6 added `.repeat()` to repeat
- `window.speechRecognition` for accepting speech input into the browser. Cool idea! But hardly supported.

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- Took a break from Tic Tac Toe to regain a little coding self-confidence. Looked to Wes Bos's JavaScript 30 tutorials for a break, but continued learning.
- Game functionalities appear to have a lot of the same functionality, so I was able to work ahead on his functions a few times!

## [15] Day 16: 2017-12-02

### Today's Progress

1. None. (Still fiddling with making user choice possible by keeping X and O visible, then making them disappear when selection happens)

### Time Spent

1 hr 11 min

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- ES6 `.includes()`, `.startsWith()`, `endsWith()` methods to find values within, starting with, or ending with. (from reading, not experimentation)

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- Forking pens seems to be the best solution to saving good work since there's no version control there.

### Resources I found helpful

- JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd ed.

## [14] Day 15: 2017-12-01

### Today's Progress

1. Removed HTML fieldset (radios for x & o) and replaced with JS function to allow choice at gameStart.
2. As an aside, worked through pair troubleshooting of a Postgres database for Women Who Code.

### Time Spent

1 hr

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- Node as a JS testing ground. Mostly an idea that I'll experiment with later.
- Continue to ask for help. Usually women in tech really want to help other women in tech.

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- Did I mention that I really don't enjoy coding games? I prefer projects that are useful to all. (i.e. Weather API)
- Near the end of my hour, I finally started making headway on the X and O choice for the player. Oh well. Tomorrow.
