# Week 3 Log

## [14] Day 15: 2017-12-01

### Today's Progress

1. Removed HTML fieldset (radios for x & o) and replaced with JS function to allow choice at gameStart.
2. As an aside, worked through pair troubleshooting of a Postgres database for Women Who Code.

### Time Spent

1 hr

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- Node as a JS testing ground. Mostly an idea that I'll experiment with later.
- Continue to ask for help. Usually women in tech really want to help other women in tech.

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- Did I mention that I really don't enjoy coding games? I prefer projects that are useful to all. (i.e. Weather API)
- Near the end of my hour, I finally started making headway on the X and O choice for the player. Oh well. Tomorrow.
