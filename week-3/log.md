# Week 3 Log

## [17] Day 18: 2017-12-04

### Today's Progress

1. Forked Tic Tac Toe pen (again) with the approach of removing JS, and starting fresh by walking through the steps again.
2. Worked on functions, conditions, and event listeners that pertained to player choice.
3. Read more out of JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd ed.
4. Troubleshooted config (.yml) file for Women Who Code.

### Time Spent

1 hr

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- Perserverance is the only winning skill in coding.
- ES6 added `Map()` constructor (not quite like an object, but kind of), `Set()` which is like but not like an array, and `Symbol` which is another data type.

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- I needed to declutter what I was looking at, though it's good valid code. I forked my pen several times before trying different solutions. Now I've forked it once again to remove all the working code, so I can walk through the steps again to see if there's a better way to approach user choice. Confidence waining a bit, as I'm convinced I'm a designer, but I want this bad enough to suffer through growing pains.

### Project I worked on

- [FCC: Tic Tac Toe](https://codepen.io/digilou/pen/POOypV)
- Women Who Code website (private repo)

### Resources I found helpful

- JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd ed.

## [16] Day 17: 2017-12-03

### Today's Progress

1. Floundered on a couple JS30 tutorials (speech recognition, geolocation) because they required more environment setup than I was prepared for. Skipped.
2. Worked through JS30 Whack-a-Mole game.

### Time Spent

1 hr 25 min

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- ES6 added `.repeat()` to repeat
- `window.speechRecognition` for accepting speech input into the browser. Cool idea! But hardly supported.

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- Took a break from Tic Tac Toe to regain a little coding self-confidence. Looked to Wes Bos's JavaScript 30 tutorials for a break, but continued learning.
- Game functionalities appear to have a lot of the same functionality, so I was able to work ahead on his functions a few times!

### Project I worked on

## [15] Day 16: 2017-12-02

### Today's Progress

1. None. (Still fiddling with making user choice possible by keeping X and O visible, then making them disappear when selection happens)

### Time Spent

1 hr 11 min

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- ES6 `.includes()`, `.startsWith()`, `endsWith()` methods to find values within, starting with, or ending with. (from reading, not experimentation)

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- Forking pens seems to be the best solution to saving good work since there's no version control there.

## [14] Day 15: 2017-12-01

### Today's Progress

1. Removed HTML fieldset (radios for x & o) and replaced with JS function to allow choice at gameStart.
2. As an aside, worked through pair troubleshooting of a Postgres database for Women Who Code.

### Time Spent

1 hr

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- Node as a JS testing ground. Mostly an idea that I'll experiment with later.
- Continue to ask for help. Usually women in tech really want to help other women in tech.

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- Did I mention that I really don't enjoy coding games? I prefer projects that are useful to all. (i.e. Weather API)
- Near the end of my hour, I finally started making headway on the X and O choice for the player. Oh well. Tomorrow.
