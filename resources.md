# Resources

I did a lot of reading and researching, but I wanted to call out the resources that heavily impacted my projects and brought me along further in my learning. Googling stuff that led me to Stack Overflow helps for task-to-task help, but these books, videos, tutorials, and challenges are my personal journey and recommendations for other code newbies.
