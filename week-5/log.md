# Week 5 Log

## [28] Day 29: 2017-12-15

### Today's Progress

1. Played with RSpec more. Added spec directory and moved test files to it.
2. Reviewed gems (Devise, Pundit) for help with authentication and authorization.
3. Walked through some Rails tutorials about creating authentication and authorization from scratch.

### Time Spent

1 hr 15 min

### Ideas/Techniques Learned
http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch
- Installing the RSpec gem doesn't automatically create a spec directory. I had to run `rails generate rspec:install`.
- Authentication and authorization basics for Rails
- I'd like to use Pundit and Devise later on down the road, without overwhelming myself too much.

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- As a beginning, I feel like I'm wasting time on BDD (behavior driven development), but since this is all new to me, it takes extra time. I think it'll be more intuitive later on. Having wireframes and a list of user tasks in front of me helps a lot!
- As I feel my way through RSpec, I need to continue learning about development of the features I want.
