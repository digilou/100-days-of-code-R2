# Week 6 Log

## [35] Day 36: 2017-12-22

### Today's Progress

1. Wrote more validations and specs for user model.

### Time Spent

1 hr 25 min

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- `expect(@user).to_not be(true)` == `assert_not @user.valid?`

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- RSpec seems to be the trend among Rails devs, but the built in test feature seems just as readable to me.
- Testing and validation feels tedious (as a n00b and tired mama) when you just want to get your page views up and working. But I'm grateful the importance is stressed throughout Hartl's book.
- Tomorrow I can learn how to add a secure password!

### Project I worked on

- Rails photo-sharing app

### Resources I found helpful
