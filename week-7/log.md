# Week 7 Log

## [42] Day 43: 2017-12-30

### Today's Progress

1. Read through WWC code changes to add OmniAuth, so I could get ideas.
2. Coded alongside ch 9 of Rails Tutorial to add remember_me token.

### Time Spent

1 hr 45 min

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- `attr_accessor`: creates “getter” and “setter” methods that allow us to retrieve (get) and assign (set) instance variables.
- Rails time helpers
- There's a difference between token and digest when creating a remember_me token. My brain finally caught on near the end of my hour of coding.

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- The more you know... Thought of the day: in coding, it takes a lot of perserverance of feeling stupid for awhile before you in start feeling confident and smart.
- Gah! The last 3-4 days I have been so tired with my child not feeling/sleeping well. So, I feel lost in my coding and that time spent isn't really productive. I have to remember that this too shall pass, and that taking a couple steps forward is still moving forward, none-the-less.
- "Remember Me" token all complete except for specs.
- Practiced working through coordination of controller, helper, model, and view. Modulation is helpful, yet confusing, at times, to find all the pieces.

### Project I worked on
