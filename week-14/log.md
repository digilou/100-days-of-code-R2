## [94] Day 95: 2018-02-21

### Today's Progress

1. Started Lesson 7 coursework (ES6 functions) for Grow with Google Scholars class.
2. Updated design for a form page.

### Time Spent

2 hr

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- `for...of` iterator allows a bit more flexibility and code simplicity for iterating over iterable items.
- Arrow functions, I've encountered before, but they are a nice clean way to code simple functions. (shouldn't all functions be simple?)

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- Perturbed that the form I worked on is a bit long, but the time crunch has left me to improvise, since the backend is unlikely to break the page apart.
- Trying to keep Bootstrap and Foundation classes straight in my head.
- Coming down to the wire on this challenge, and some projects I'm working through.
