# Week 12

## [77] Day 78: 2018-02-03

### Today's Progress

1. Updated local environment for Women Who Code contributions.
2. Updated WWC About page.
3. Took notes on RSpec.

### Time Spent

1 hr 30 min

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- DevOps troubleshooting:
  - Sometimes a fresh clone fixes everything! (and sometimes it breaks more things)
- RSpec:
  - `describe()` && `context()` == example group that describes a feature
  - `it()` == code examples that describe expected behavior of that feature
  - `expect` instead of `assert`
  - `include` && `behaves_like` shares blocks
  - `pending()` flags a BDD test in progress, but doesn't get lost like code that's commented out

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- Too much time on env updates again. At least (almost) everything is working. Vagrant and Virtual box connections work!

### Project I worked on

- Women Who Code website
- RSpec learning

### Resources I found helpful

- The RSpec book: behaviour-driven development with RSpec, Cucumber, and Friends
