# Week 12

## [80] Day 81: 2018-02-06

### Today's Progress

1. Watched a Fun Fun Function videos about `promises`.
2. Finished reading about functions in "Programming JavaScript Applications" book.
3. Added to my JS cheatsheet.

### Time Spent

1 hr

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- Promises are like callbacks, but more so with more features. But they're not supported in IE11! (without polyfill)

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- I'll get back to my photo app soon. Trying to grasp some JS concepts for coursework and side project, first.
- I need to find something more applicable to test out the use of promises. I'm seeing this in my coursework a lot though, which is funny since he says he uses ES5, but promises are ES6.

## [79] Day 80: 2018-02-05

### Today's Progress

1. Watched another Fun Fun Function videos about `.bind()` and `this`.
2. Read about functions in "Programming JavaScript Applications" book.
3. Added to my JS cheatsheet.

### Time Spent

1 hr

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- n/a

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- Scattered in thought today.

### Project I worked on

## [78] Day 79: 2018-02-04

### Today's Progress

1. Quick update to WWC about page.
2. Watched a couple Fun Fun Function videos about `.bind()` and `this`.
3. Started "Programming JavaScript Applications" book.
4. Added more code examples to my JS cheatsheet.

### Time Spent

1 hr 30 min

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- Didn't fully realize the problems `this` could present. Know I understand the scope a little better when a method with `this` is assigned to a variable, and that function (lambda?) is called.
- Lambda is a function used as a data variable or return value.

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- Learning JavaScript really is like falling down a rabbit hole!
- It's encouraging to see JS devs have a sense of humor about JS's quirks and hardships, yet still loving it and acknowleding how useful and relevant the language is.
- I need to learn more about JS testing (TDD). While learning RSpec (BDD), I should be able to pick it up a little quicker. Looks like React has something built-in for testing.

## [77] Day 78: 2018-02-03

### Today's Progress

1. Updated local environment for Women Who Code contributions.
2. Updated WWC About page.
3. Took notes on RSpec.

### Time Spent

1 hr 30 min

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- DevOps troubleshooting:
  - Sometimes a fresh clone fixes everything! (and sometimes it breaks more things)
- RSpec:
  - `describe()` && `context()` == example group that describes a feature
  - `it()` == code examples that describe expected behavior of that feature
  - `expect` instead of `assert`
  - `include` && `behaves_like` shares blocks
  - `pending()` flags a BDD test in progress, but doesn't get lost like code that's commented out

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- Too much time on env updates again. At least (almost) everything is working. Vagrant and Virtual box connections work!

### Project I worked on

- Women Who Code website
- RSpec learning

### Resources I found helpful

- The RSpec book: behaviour-driven development with RSpec, Cucumber, and Friends
