# Week 9

## [57] Day 58: 2018-01-014

### Today's Progress

1. Wrote and submitted first C program "hello, world" to CS50 (week 1).
2. Started ch13 of Rails Tutorial by generating microposts model and writing specs.

### Time Spent

1 hr 35 min

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- `text` data type allows more than 255 characters.
- `reference` type associates (references) models.
- RSpec: `assert microposts.valid?` == `expect(microposts).to be true`. (I think??)

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- I probably shouldn't have wasted half of my hour with CS50, instead of working on my Rails app, but late afternoon programming session had me worn out and I was more inclined to ease into my hour with tutorials and a tiny C program than thinking harder about my app (and screwing it up).
- CS50 is a distraction, but I'll try to take it slow. It is nice to see that I understand some C already, thanks to JavaScript and Python! I may not always count it as part of my 100 days, if I'm doing more videos than coding.
- Still feeling my way blindly through converting Rails Test syntax to RSpec syntax.

## [56] Day 57: 2018-01-013

### Today's Progress

1. Password reset functionality complete and pushed to production.

### Time Spent

2 hr

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- No "ah-ha!" moments today.

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- I've come a long way on this app. So glad I'm getting somewhere. The hard part is still ahead, as I walk off the ledge of tutorials and take that leap of faith that I can construct the image sharing pieces with the help of my own logic/reasoning and StackOverflow.
