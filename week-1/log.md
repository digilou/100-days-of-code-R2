Week 1 Log

## [0] Day 1: 2017-11-17

### Today's Progress

1. Init Round 2. Set up my Github repo to mimic my other 100 Days of Code repo, but with improvements and personailzed tweaks to suit my needs.

2. Watched Gunnar Bittersmann's [An inclusive tic-tac-toe, progressively enhanced video](https://youtu.be/36i2o26JE2M) from #ID24. That was timely!

3. Started a new pen for my Tic Tac Toe project (Free Code Camp). It's been too long since I've touched it and just need to start over. I'm starting with Gunnar's approach because accessibility was nagging at me anyhow, so this gives me a course to accomplish that goal!

4. Coded most of HTML base for the game. I'm liking the new approach. It's making me think about the basic experience.

5. In the end, I spent most of my time just getting myself organized and set up. But I suppose I expected that, even though I wanted to dive into code a little sooner. The video was important to watch. And documentation is something I'm striving to maintain better this time around. Besides, new projects always promise dev environment setup, orientation, and extra learning.

### Time Spent

1 hr 33 min

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- a radio button is an ingenious way to show the choice the user has and the states of tic tac toe
- Emmet can be a quick way to help type HTML quicker without going down the rabbit hole of HTML pre-processors (Pug, Haml)
- Pug does have benefits and value, but I'll tackle that another day

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- Let's do this! I know what I'm in for, which makes me wonder how I'll do this time. Can I stay committed? Accountability helps. Can I stay focused? I have strong intentions.

- Gunnar's approach to making TicTacToe accessible/usable through progressive enhancement was MIND-BLOWING. This is how I want to approach things more naturally. With my strengths lying in HTML and CSS, this shouldn't be too difficult.

- How should I handle the markup of "score" in my game? What semantics make the most sense?

### Project I worked on
