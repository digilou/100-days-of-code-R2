# Week 10

## [63] Day 64: 2018-01-20

### Today's Progress

1. Created form for submitting microposts.
2. Refactored some page code into partials.
3. Added 'delete micropost' functionality.

### Time Spent

1 hr 50 min

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- `"aria-label": "Compose microposts."` is how to insert aria attributes into ERB.
- `redirect_back(fallback_location: root_url)` for redirecting user back to page they were on, after an event (like delete post) happens.

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- So tired today that I didn't want to code. BUT, little progress is better than no progress at all. Now I'm a little further along on microposts.
- Did some extra time in the afternoon. Mind was a lot clearer then after coffee, time with family, and a brief Doctor Who break.
