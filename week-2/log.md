# Week 2 Log

## [7] Day 8: 2017-11-24

### Today's Progress

1. Combed through my Tic Tac Toe code to try and figure out why player's choice is not working.
2. After 45 minutes, resolved typos, which fixed my player selection problem.

### Time Spent

1 hr 6 min

### Ideas/Techniques Learned

- `::after` is CSS3 and `:after` is CSS2
- CodePen has an Analyze CSS feature, which I should have used much sooner. Typos happen.

### Thoughts, Ideas, Questions

- Always, always, always read letter by letter. I resolved my `fieldset` and `label::after` problems all because of types "fieldet" and "positon" were misspelled.
